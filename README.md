## AI in Financial Analytics
Analysing financial data with the goal of making informed business decisions can be challenging without the right domain knowledge, mathematical and statistical skillsets. By leveraging Generative AI, I was able to bridge this gap. I implemented AI solutions that is able to analyse financial data, perform statistical techniques and generate insights that help humans to make strategic business decisions more rapidly.

The AI can perform complex calculations to perform financial analysis such as Liquidity Analysis and Accounts Receivable Turnover Analysis. 

Examples of insights:

> The company's Quick Ratio for the latest month is approximately 1.71, indicating it has $1.71 in liquid assets for every $1 of current liabilities.

> The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is calculated to be approximately 0.36, indicating the company is slow in collecting outstanding accounts.
